 * \brief Provide an example
 *
 * This class is meant as an example.  It is not useful by itself
 * rather its usefulness is only a function of how much it helps
 * the reader.  It is in a sense defined by the person who reads it
 * and otherwise does not exist in any real form. 
 *
 * \note Attempts at zen rarely work.
